# Python-maths-scripts

Random Python code about mathematical things

## ackermann.py
Implementation of the Ackermann function: ATTENTION: Recursive Recursive-ness;
runtime gets infinite VERY quickly (just as the ackermann function is one of
the fastest-rising functions known)

## mandel_test.py
Test-Script about the Mandelbrot Set

## mandelbrot_set.py
like _mandel_test.py_ but with a better graphical representation

## palindrome_check.py
checks if a number is a palindrome; that is; a number that starts and ends with
the same digits

## prime_test_generator.py
generates prime numbers from 1 to N

## roulette_winnings_simulator.py
Pseudo-Monte Carlo Simulation where a player bets on either red and blue at
roulette and doubles his bet each time he loses.
Averages the winnings with this strategy over many games.
(Spoiler: On average, you get your initial bet back, just as combinatorics
predicts...)
